# Radio Telescope Embedded System Test
The objective of this program is to test the York County Astronomical Society Radio Telescope's Sensor Network. This program has the ability to determine reliability of data transmission, as well as display the data being received.

We also have the ability to create custom packets that we can either send to this program, or the control room. This exists primarily for creating unit tests to test the various parts of the application.

Next, there is the ability to draw out CSV files that can be used in both unit testing, and for a simulation that can run within the control room software, or separate, so that we don't always have to have the Sensor Network hardware hooked up.
